## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

### What metric or metrics are you going to test?
#### Safety, Engine, Annual cost of ownership, gasoline efficiency, selling price. 

### What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
#### Null: MechaCar is priced well. 
#### Alternative: it is not priced correctly based on the factors we tested. 

### What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why? What data is needed to run the statistical test?
#### A multiple linear regression would be used to determine the factors that have the highest correlation/predictability with the list selling price (dependent variable); which combination has the greatest impact on price.
